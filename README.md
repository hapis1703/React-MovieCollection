# Installation

Install This Project To your computer

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hapis1703/React-MovieCollection.git
```

You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

### Node, JDK

We recommend installing Node via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a popular package manager for Windows.

It is recommended to use an LTS version of Node. If you want to be able to switch between different versions, you might want to install Node via [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), a Node version manager for Windows.

React Native also requires [Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/), which can be installed using Chocolatey as well.

Open an Administrator Command Prompt (right click Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator"), then run the following command:

```bash
choco install -y nodejs-lts openjdk11
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 14 or newer. If you already have a JDK on your system, make sure it is version 11 or newer.
